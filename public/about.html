<h1>About Me</h1>
<img src="../assets/images/selfie.jpeg" alt="selfie of Ryan Wilcox" />
<p>My name is Ryan Wilcox. I was an educator for 11 years before I decided to jump 
  into the world of web development and coding in the summer of 2025.</p>

<p>I have always been interested in technology, so making this jump into coding and web development
  feels like a logical extension of that passion.</p>

<p>I am interested in developing visually appealing websites that are also highly engaging
  and useful. Whether that is personal projects or more expansive ones, I am eager to put
  my skills and knowledge to work.</p>
