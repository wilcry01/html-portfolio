    <p>This was the first Miyazaki film I ever watched, so there is a lot of sentimental value for me. 
    I was lucky enough to see it in theaters when it released in the U.S.. I was blown away by the visuals and incredible story.</p>

 <h3>#2 Princess Mononoke</h3>

    <p>I love dark, complex themes of this film. I think it is an interesting commentary on the power of nature versus industrialization. 
    What a stellar voice cast as well!</p>

 <h3>#3 Howl's Moving Castle</h3>

     <p>The whimsy and charm of this movie are spectacular! I loved the exploration on how looks can be deceiving. 
    What a great adaptation of the novel of the same name.</p>
